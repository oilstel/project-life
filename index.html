        <p>Dear <input type="text">,</p>
    
        <p>You are invited to Project your Life with us, Gijs and Elliott, on <span class="highlight">March 26, 2024</span> 14-17h at Extra Practice.</p>

        <p>Projecting Life, you may ask? Sometimes life is just too full of things ‚Äì what we call a <em>Project Life</em>, while other times it's consumed by one thing ‚Äì a <em>Life Project</em>. In both Life-Types you can get lost; in both you may want to be in the other.</p>

        <p>To help find our route through all of this we take cues from climbing. When you fall from a boulder, you can do two things: leave it or <em>project</em> it: committing to trying it, for an hour, day, month, until you're up. Whatever your Life-Type, we'll help each other Project our Lives.</p>
